# ðŸ¥§ PIE (PHP Installer for Extensions)

You will need PHP 8.1 or newer to run PIE, but PIE can install an extension to
any installed PHP version.

If you are an extension maintainer wanting to add PIE support to your extension,
please read [extension-maintainers](./docs/extension-maintainers.md).

## Installing PIE

### Manual installation

- Download `pie.phar` from the [latest releases](https://github.com/php/pie/releases)
- Validate the signature in `pie.phar.asc`
- You may then invoke PIE with `php pie.phar <command>`

Further installation details can be found in the [usage](./docs/usage.md) docs.
This documentation assumes you have moved `pie.phar` into your `$PATH`, e.g.
`/usr/local/bin/pie` on non-Windows systems.

## Extensions that support PIE

A list of extensions that support PIE can be found on
[https://packagist.org/extensions](https://packagist.org/extensions).

## Installing an extension using PIE

You can install an extension using the `install` command. For example, to
install the `example_pie_extension` extension, you would run:

```shell
$ pie install example/example-pie-extension
This command may need elevated privileges, and may prompt you for your password.
You are running PHP 8.3.10
Target PHP installation: 8.3.10 nts, on Linux/OSX/etc x86_64 (from /usr/bin/php8.3)
